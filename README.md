# rtm-milkscript-scripts
A collection of MilkScript utilities for Remember the Milk

[Remember the Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/) is a To Do list app that has an add-on for Pro (premium paying) users called [MilkScript](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/milkscript/). 

MilkScript lets you create scripts (written in JavaScript) to query and automate your RTM account. 

This repo is a collection of scripts that I've written to create reports of Completed items. At least, so far. It's not restricted to only these types of scripts.

Please feel to send me a pull request to add other useful scripts.

## Installation
To 'install' a script, copy the content, and paste it into a new MilkScript script that you create in your account.

## Notes
* For scripts that run a report for the past, I've not fully tested runs that occur on January 1, or in January. Feedback welcome!
